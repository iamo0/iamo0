- 👋 Hi, I’m Igor
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Structures, algorithms, interfaces and TDD
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code again after some 3 years of managing people and products
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects as a Fullstack JS Developer or a manager
- 📫 How to reach me is shown in my bio
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wouldn've made this README if Github didn't recommend me to

I've worked as a Software Developer for
- Art Lebedev Studio
- Ostrovok.ru
- JetBrains

For five years I've been teaching people how to write JS applications at HTML Academy

I've attended several conferences and was a guest to podcasts. Here is YouTube playlist with all the recordings: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmOh95BPNWptLjbHydIIYoOm1GOhRtCom&si=9_qGkqRunC79A189
