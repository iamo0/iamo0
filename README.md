- 👋 Hi, I’m Igor
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Structures, algorithms, interfaces and TDD
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code again after some 3 years of managing people and products
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects as a Fullstack JS Developer or a manager
- 📫 How to reach me is shown in my bio
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wouldn've made this README if Github didn't recommend me to

I've worked as a Software Developer for
- [Art Lebedev Studio](https://artlebedev.ru/o0) | [En🇬🇧](https://artlebedev.com)
- [Ostrovok.ru](https://ostrovok.ru)
- [JetBrains](https://jetbrains.com)

For five years I've taught around 3000 people how to write JS applications at [HTML Academy](https://htmlacademy.ru) 

I've attended several conferences and was a guest to podcasts. I've made a [YouTube playlist with all the recordings](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmOh95BPNWptLjbHydIIYoOm1GOhRtCom&si=9_qGkqRunC79A189).

This GitHub profile is started from scratch, because I've lost access to [my old one (@o0)](https://github.com/o0), thanks to Google Authenticator. Yet, I might fork some things from it to this account in future.
